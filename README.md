**Technical Writing Projects**

The documents and presentations displayed in this commit are a quick example of a handful of projects I had done throughout my education and internship.  

The Enhanced Rolling Horizon Evolution Algorithm paper, as well as the conjoined presentation and the Final Project were two sets of papers I had completed for my IS 369 Writing for Technical Professionals course I had undertaken at UMBC.  

Meanwhile, the Data Steward Framework was something I had helped the Senior Data Governance Officer of MLP LLC draft and eventually publish to the Data Governance sector of SSA.
